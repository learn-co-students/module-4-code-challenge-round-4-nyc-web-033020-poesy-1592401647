/* Deliverables:
1) âˆšWhen the app starts, I can see all currently created poems.
2) I can show/hide the form to create new poems.
3) I can create poems and they are still there when I refresh the page -> POST request
4) I can mark poems as read which will change the text of that button to "Mark as unread".
